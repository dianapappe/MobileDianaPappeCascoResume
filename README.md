Project 3: Dynamic Image Viewer App
CSCE 3220.401-10460 Human Computer Interface

Create an Android application that focuses on user interface design. 
This project will help you understand how to build visually appealing and user-friendly Android apps. 
Follow the guidelines below:

Tasks:

    User Interface Design: Design an Android app with a user-friendly interface. Create a layout with at least three buttons, each labeled with a unique color, and include icons on the buttons.

    Image Resources: Add a minimum of three images to the project's drawable resources. These images should be distinct from each other.

    Button Click Handling: Implement click event handlers for each button. When a button is clicked, the displayed image should change to a different one based on the button's function.

    Image Transition: Ensure a smooth transition between images. You can use cross-fade animation, image switching, or any other method to create a pleasant user experience.

    Color Styling: Apply unique background colors to the buttons to make them visually appealing. The color choice can match the button labels or have a creative touch.

    GitHub Repository: All code and project files should be stored on a GitHub repository. Students must provide the GitHub repository link as a deliverable.

    Here's the instruction for your reference:

    "For guidance on how to connect version control, specifically GitHub, to Android Studio, you can watch the 'Android Studio Essential Training' course on LinkedIn Learning. Refer to Section "3. Use software version control" in the course to learn how to set up version control within Android Studio. This will help you manage your project and collaborate effectively. 

    Material Design Theme Colors: Configure the Material Design theme colors to make the top bar visually appealing.
